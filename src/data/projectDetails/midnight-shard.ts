    description: "Midnight Shard is a sinister weapon from Shadow Slave, formed from condensed darkness and shattered shadow essence. The blade appears as a jagged fragment rather than a traditional sword, its uneven crystalline structure resembling black glass frozen mid-explosion. Subtle fractures run through its surface, giving it an unstable, predatory presence, as if the weapon itself is barely restrained. Light is swallowed along its edges, leaving only faint, cold highlights that emphasize its lethal sharpness. Midnight Shard feels less like a forged tool and more like a cursed relic, perfectly suited for a wielder bound to shadows and the horrors of the Dream Realm.",
