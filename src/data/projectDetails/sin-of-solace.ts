    description: "Sin of Solace is the sword carried by Sunless during the Third Nightmare, a weapon that reflects both his growth and the crushing weight of his resolve. The blade is long, dark, and unnervingly simple, forged in a way that feels less like craftsmanship and more like inevitability, with an obsidian surface that seems to drink in light rather than reflect it. Subtle imperfections and stress marks run along the blade, hinting at countless battles and the quiet suffering bound to it, while the restrained design avoids ornamentation entirely, reinforcing its purpose as a tool of survival rather than glory. This 3D model captures the oppressive presence and emotional gravity of Sin of Solace, making it ideal for Shadow Slave inspired scenes, dark fantasy environments, and character focused renders where the weapon is as much a burden as it is a means to endure.",
