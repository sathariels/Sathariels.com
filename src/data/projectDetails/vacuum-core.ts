    description: "This Unreal Engine experiment explores kinetic feedback through a custom-coded 'Singularity Launcher.' Using a modified asset base, I developed a mechanism where projectiles trigger a two-phase environmental event: an initial spatial collapse followed by a high-velocity radial outburst. The project highlights my ability to bridge asset modification with complex logic to create unique, high-impact gameplay interactions.",
